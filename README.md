# TOR-Over-DSN
The Most Secure VPN ever, this repository aims to implement [TOR Onion Routing](https://www.torproject.org/) over [Nasa's Deep Space Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network), in order to:

0. **prevent timing attacks:** who knows what lag will be like as your data zooms through space. 
0. **prevent man-in-them-middle attacks:** Unless there are aliens, there literally will be nothing in the middle. 

## Nasa Cooperation
As of yet, Nasa won't return my emails or phone calls or texts, but I'm diligent. Will keep you posted.
