# TOR-Over-DSN
Implements the TOR Onion Routing protocol over the NASA Deep Space Network

The Most Secure VPN ever, this repository aims to implement TOR over Nasa's Deep Space Network, in order to prevent timing attacks, and of course since we are talking about space, there won't be a man in the middle, because its deep space. So basically unless there are alians this is NSA grade code.
